# movie-search-app

Movie Search Engine to find available movies

### Setup

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 10.16 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To run this project on your local machine:

```sh
* git clone https://github.com/sghanapuram/movie-search-app.git
* npm install
* npm start
```

Open your browser and run:

```sh
http://localhost:3000/
```

To execute tests, run:

```sh
npm test
```
###### Challenges

One of the challenges I ran into was to get the image using the poster path coming from /search/movie response.

###### Future Enhancements
* Implement Pagination
* Configure webpack to add loaders like css-loaders, sass-loader and style-loader to read scss files that provide advanced syntax and nested styling
* Add more unit tests to test hooks and api call
